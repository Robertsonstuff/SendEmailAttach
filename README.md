# SendEmailAttach
This will send out to multiple email addresses (as many as you want) an email from a Gmail account.
This code doesn't need any external modules but you'll notice it needs some Environment variables.
One will need to be your (gmail) email address. The other will need to be your password - but not from your gmail log in! This password needs to be your 'app password' generated from your google account. This is found under the security tab. You may also need to activate your 2-step authentication to generate your 'App password' from your google account. This should be easy to find via a quick google search or having a scan through your google account settings.
Enjoy!
